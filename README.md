🛰️ Semantic Segmentation for Object Identification from Satellite Imagery
📖 Overview

This project presents an end-to-end pipeline for semantic segmentation of high-resolution satellite imagery, focusing on the Dhaka district of Bangladesh. The primary goal was to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying and classifying objects at the pixel level.

A key contribution of this work is the creation of a novel, meticulously annotated dataset of over 2900 image patches. The project utilizes the DeepLabv3+ architecture and demonstrates excellent performance, offering a robust workflow from raw data collection to model evaluation.

✨ Key Features

Custom Dataset: A unique, pixel-level annotated dataset of 2900+ 512x512 satellite image patches.

High-Performance Model: Achieved a mIoU of 0.9106 for binary-class segmentation.

End-to-End Pipeline: A complete, 9-step data processing pipeline from image acquisition to model-ready dataset.

Reproducibility: Comprehensive experiment tracking using Weights & Biases across 6+ major training runs.

🏞️ The Dhaka Satellite Imagery Dataset

The dataset developed in this project is a core component of the research. It consists of:

2900+ Image Patches: Each resized to 512x512 pixels.

High-Resolution Source: Derived from geotagged .tiff satellite imagery.

Pixel-Level Annotations: Each image is paired with a manually created segmentation mask, ideal for supervised learning tasks.

Geographical Focus: All imagery is sourced from the Dhaka district, offering a specialized dataset for urban object analysis.

⚙️ Methodology & Pipeline

The project follows a structured, 9-step pipeline:
